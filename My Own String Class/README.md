In this project I create and implement my own string class called TString, imitating the string class provided by the C++ Standard Library. My own string class can basically fuifill all kinds of string operations, i.e., input, output, compare, concatenate, all kinds of operation overloads, etc.

Multiple inheritance is used in the process of creating this string class. To increase the running efficiency, after implementing TString class, I create another class called TString_wonderful. This class uses linked list to finish the operations defined in TString class, so that the efficiency will be very high.

Lots of test examples are provided to test the result of my implementation. You can see that the results made by my own class and made by the built-in string class are all the same. At last, there are three modules to test the running speed of TString class, built-in string class and TString_wonderful class, by letting them to dynamically apply for 100MB memory space. It is easy to see that the running efficiency of TString_wonderful class and the built-in string class are nearly the same.
